## Part 2.10

Since I had been working on these exercises on [Play-with-docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com), I already had all the buttons working. The changes I made is in the `backend` service's `FRONT_URL` environment variable to match with the nginx URL.

The Dockerfiles of [backend](../part2-3/backend/Dockerfile), [frontend](../part2-3/frontend/Dockerfile) and the [docker-compose](../part2-8/docker-compose.yml) are linked.
